- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chakshu8


I did my MSc. Computer Science from Newcastle University. I have relevant web development experience, and I am looking for a position where I can employ my knowledge and skills.
During my information technology job at Matrix Academy, I developed numerous skills and strengthened existing abilities. My IT Member job honed my aptitude with object-oriented programming, user interfaces, wireframes, and web development and designing tools/technologies, among other areas.

Several of my job responsibilities while at Matrix Academy included:

â€¢	Developed and designed a full-stack dynamic website of Matrix Academy integrating HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, Version Control (GIT), PHP, MySQL, and CodeIgniter MVC.
â€¢	Developed effective team working skills while maintaining, testing and updating the website on daily basis.
â€¢	Managed the YouTube channel by implementing attractive thumbnails and executing SEO which results in a 50% more increased number of subscribers and viewers.
â€¢	Developed verbal communication and leadership skills while training junior developers and leading a team of 6 members to deliver various Front-End and Back-End projects.

As these few responsibilities show, I am not only fond of the web development work that I do, but I take great pride in it, as well. I will bring that same work ethic and drive.
In addition to my knowledge base, I actively seek out new technologies and stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements. This has allowed me to stay ahead of the curve and deliver exceptional work to all of my employers, including those I've worked for on a project basis.
I can be reached anytime via my phone, at +44-7471044310 or by email at chakshu1996goyal@gmail.com.
